/**
 * This file contains an minimal example of a Linear "OpMode". An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either
 * the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match. The names of OpModes appear on the menu
 * of the FTC Driver Station. When an selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode
 * class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 *
 * This particular OpMode just executes a basic Tank Drive Teleop for a two wheeled robot
 * It includes all the skeletal structure that all linear OpModes contain.
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list

     * Steps for Autonomous:
     * 1. Extend Bar
     * 2. Use Color Sensor to Detect Jewel Color
     * 3. Hit Opposing Alliance Jewel w/ Bar
     * 4. Detract Bar
     * 5. Read Image w/ Vuforia (Done!) 
     * 6. Go off platform towards shelves
     * 7. Reorient Robot (reorient to 90/270 degrees if on platforms furthest from glpyh placement area)
     * Loop:
     *     8. Move across shelf slowly w/ Range Sensor
     *     9. Use counter var. to count how many times the Range Sensor reading suddenly dipped
     *     (shelf edges - 3.93" inches (approx 9.98 cm.) deep) and compare the var. to the key slot value
     * 10. Reorient robot after it finds the correct slot
     * 11. Park in parking zone by moving back (or forwards) to the 2nd slot (^similar loop)
