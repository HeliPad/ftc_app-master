/**
 * This OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine
 * positioning and orientation of robot on the FTC field.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * Vuforia uses the phone's camera to inspect it's surroundings, and attempt to locate target images.
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code than combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * This example assumes a "diamond" field configuration where the red and blue alliance stations
 * are adjacent on the corner of the field furthest from the audience.
 * From the Audience perspective, the Red driver station is on the right.
 * The two vision target are located on the two walls closest to the audience, facing in.
 * The Stones are on the RED side of the field, and the Chips are on the Blue side.
 *
 * A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * @see VuforiaLocalizer
 * @see VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener
 * see  ftc_app/doc/tutorial/FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.

         * In order for localization to work, we need to tell the system where each target we
         * wish to use for navigation resides on the field, and we need to specify where on the robot
         * the phone resides. These specifications are in the form of <em>transformation matrices.</em>
         * Transformation matrices are a central, important concept in the math here involved in localization.
         * See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix">Transformation Matrix</a>
         * for detailed information. Commonly, you'll encounter transformation matrices as instances
         * of the {@link OpenGLMatrix} class.
         *
         * For the most part, you don't need to understand the details of the math of how transformation
         * matrices work inside (as fascinating as that is, truly). Just remember these key points:
         * <ol>
         *
         *     <li>You can put two transformations together to produce a third that combines the effect of
         *     both of them. If, for example, you have a rotation transform R and a translation transform T,
         *     then the combined transformation matrix RT which does the rotation first and then the translation
         *     is given by {@code RT = T.multiplied(R)}. That is, the transforms are multiplied in the
         *     <em>reverse</em> of the chronological order in which they applied.</li>
         *
         *     <li>A common way to create useful transforms is to use methods in the {@link OpenGLMatrix}
         *     class and the Orientation class. See, for example, {@link OpenGLMatrix#translation(float,
         *     float, float)}, {@link OpenGLMatrix#rotation(AngleUnit, float, float, float, float)}, and
         *     {@link Orientation#getRotationMatrix(AxesReference, AxesOrder, AngleUnit, float, float, float)}.
         *     Related methods in {@link OpenGLMatrix}, such as {@link OpenGLMatrix#rotated(AngleUnit,
         *     float, float, float, float)}, are syntactic shorthands for creating a new transform and
         *     then immediately multiplying the receiver by it, which can be convenient at times.</li>
         *
         *     <li>If you want to break open the black box of a transformation matrix to understand
         *     what it's doing inside, use {@link MatrixF#getTranslation()} to fetch how much the
         *     transform will move you in x, y, and z, and use {@link Orientation#getOrientation(MatrixF,
         *     AxesReference, AxesOrder, AngleUnit)} to determine the rotational motion that the transform
         *     will impart. See {@link #format(OpenGLMatrix)} below for an example.</li>
         *
         * </ol>
         *
         * This example places the "stones" image on the perimeter wall to the Left
         *  of the Red Driver station wall.  Similar to the Red Beacon Location on the Res-Q
         *
         * This example places the "chips" image on the perimeter wall to the Right
         *  of the Blue Driver station.  Similar to the Blue Beacon Location on the Res-Q
         *
         * See the doc folder of this project for a description of the field Axis conventions.
         *
         * Initially the target is conceptually lying at the origin of the field's coordinate system
         * (the center of the field), facing up.
         *
         * In this configuration, the target's coordinate system aligns with that of the field.
         *
         * In a real situation we'd also account for the vertical (Z) offset of the target,
         * but for simplicity, we ignore that here; for a real robot, you'll want to fix that.
         *
         * To place the Stones Target on the Red Audience wall:
         * - First we rotate it 90 around the field's X axis to flip it upright
         * - Then we rotate it  90 around the field's Z access to face it away from the audience.
